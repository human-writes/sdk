## Troubleshooting Q&A

**Q**: I've chained two components but none is starting, what happens?

**A**: Either components reference each other or one is referencing an element selector that doesn't exist in the
rendered DOM.

## Known issues

CodeWriter can be used several times in the same vue but you cannot use a different HighlightJs theme for each of them.
